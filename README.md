PHP Starter Pack
================

### PHP-MySQL-Ansible-Vagrant *Starter Pack*

This is a starter template for quickly developing a modern PHP project locally with Vagrant, which is then easily deployed live with Ansible. It builds everything you need to enjoy development with a self-contained and disposable virtual machine:
 - **Vagrant** VM based on **Ubuntu 18.04**
 - **PHP 7.3** and Composer
 - **Nginx** for static files with catch-all proxy to **PHP-FPM**
 - **MySQL** database and user

### Features
- Ansible playbook with configuration for both local development and production
- Easily add Ansible Galaxy roles for additional infrastructure with `ansible/requirements.yml`
- Automatically installs PHP dependencies from `composer.json`
- Minimal ["no-framework"](https://kevinsmith.io/modern-php-without-a-framework) `index.php` with automatic routing and exception handling (optional)

### Makefile Shortcuts
- `make db` - run db.sql to create project tables
- `make start/restart/stop` - start/restart/stop Nginx & PHP-FPM 
- `make provision-dev` - run ansible playbook for localhost/dev
- `make provision-prod` - run ansible playbook for production group
- `make install-galaxy-roles` - install galaxy roles from `ansible/requirements.yml`

### Local Development

0. You'll need VM software like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (Mac/PC) or [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/) (Mac)

0. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for automating VMs.

0. Clone this repo as your project name: **(This is important, the project folder name will be used for initial configuration of database name, hostname, etc.)**
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:paste/php-starter-pack.git my-project-name
    ```

0. Build your Vagrant VM:

    ```sh
    vagrant up
    ```

0. Modify your computer's local `/etc/hosts`:

    ```
    192.168.33.73   my-project-name.local
    ```

0. Visit your app:
    ```
    http://my-project-name.local
    ```

0. Log into the VM via SSH and run db.sql to create example data:
    ```sh
    vagrant ssh
    cd my-project-name
    make db
    ```

0. Visit example page with DB query results:
    ```
    http://my-project-name.local/example/results
    ```

0. **Profit** :heavy_check_mark:

### Production

0. You'll need a remote user with `sudo` privileges for Ansible to provision with â€“ don't use `root`.

0. Edit the `prod` group in `ansible/inventory.yml` and set the `ansible_user` and `ansible_host`. This is the SSH user and host to connect to. See here for more details:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html

0. Set the production `host_name` in `ansible/group_vars/prod.yml`. This is the domain that Nginx will use.

0. It's handy to provision from within your Vagrant VM since it already has Ansible installed. Log into the VM and run the Ansible playbook for the production group:
    ```sh
    vagrant ssh
    cd my-project-name
    make provision-prod
    ```
